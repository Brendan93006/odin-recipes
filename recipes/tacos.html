    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Birria de res tacos are a Mexican dish made with beef (res) that’s braised or slow-cooked in a rich, chili- and spice-infused sauce until it becomes tender and flavorful. The meat is usually shredded and served inside warm corn tortillas, often dipped in the cooking broth (consomé) before being griddled, which gives the tacos a crispy, golden exterior.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Dried chile peppers</li>
        <li>Beef</li>
        <li>Seasonings</li>

        <li>Tomatoes</li>

        <li>Tortillas</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>

        <li>Boil the dried peppers for 5 minutes, then remove from heat and let the peppers soak until the water is cool. Drain, reserving some water.</li>
